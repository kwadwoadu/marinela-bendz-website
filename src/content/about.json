    "As a property hunter in Barcelona, I specialise in finding the right property for my clients - whether for investment or as a home. My job is to research, shortlist, visit, and evaluate each property, so you can save time and energy to focus on other priorities.",
    "Driven by my Scandinavian roots and work ethic, I take great pride in delivering a service built on excellence. My clients can expect high standards with attention to detail and accountability in every step of the collaboration.",
    "Unlike traditional real estate agents, I work exclusively for the buyers: No conflict of interest, no seller-side commission. My service is contracted at a fixed rate regardless of the property price; ensuring my advice and recommendations are unbiased and always aligned with your best interests."
